c) The left shift operator can be used as an alternative to multiplying by 2
d) The right shift operator automatically fills the higher order bits with 0
Answer: d
Explanation: The right shift operator automatically fills the higher order bit with its previous contents each time a shift occurs. This also preserves the sign of the value.

Explanation: b >> 1 in if returns 5 which is equal to a i:e 5, therefore body of if is executed and block second is exited.  Control  goes to end of the block second executing the last print statement, printing 10.
output:
$ javac Output.java
$ java Output
10

a) Compilation error
b) Runtime error
c) Compilation and runs successfully
d) Only String return type is allowed

I mark phase all the objects reachable by java threads, native handles and other root sources are marked alive and others are garbage. In sweep phase, the heap is traversed to find gaps between live objects and the gaps are marked free list used for allocating memory to new objects.

1228. QUESTION: 
a) 10 20
b) 20 10
c) 20 40
d) 40 20
Answer: a
Explanation: Variables a & b are passed by value, copy of their values are made on formal parameters of function meth() that is i & j. Therefore changes done on i & j are not reflected back on original arguments. a & b remain 10 & 20 respectively.

1247. QUESTION: Can a class be declared with a protected modifier.
a) True
b) False
Answer: b

Since there is no such concept as ‘subpackage’ or ‘package-inheritance’ in Java, declaring class protected or package-private would be the same thing.

1248. QUESTION: Which is the modifier when there is none mentioned explicitly?

0

1627. QUESTION: 
a) 1
b) 2
c) 3
d) 4

1900. QUESTION: 
a) 0
b) 1
c) true
d) false
Answer: c
Explanation: isAlive() method is used to check whether the thread being called is running or not, here thread is the main() method which is running till the program is terminated hence it returns true.
Output:
$ javac multithreaded_programing.java
$ java multithreaded_programing
true

1901. QUESTION: 
a) true
b) false
c) truetrue
d) falsefalse
Answer: d
Explanation: This program was previously done by using Runnable interface, here we have used Thread class. This shows both the method are equivalent, we can use any of them to create a thread.
Output:
$ javac multithreaded_programing.java
$ java multithreaded_programing
falsefalse

1902. QUESTION: Which of these method is used to implement Runnable interface?

1904. QUESTION: Which of these statement is incorrect?
a) A thread can be formed by implementing Runnable interface only
b) A thread can be formed by a class that extends Thread class
c) start() method is used to begin execution of the thread
d) run() method is used to begin execution of a thread before start() method in special cases
Answer: d
Explanation: run() method is used to define the code that constitutes the new thread, it contains the code to be executed. start() method is used to begin execution of the thread that is execution of run(). run() itself is never used for starting execution of the thread.

Thread[My Thread,5,main]

1907. QUESTION: 
a) My Thread
b) Thread[My Thread,5,main].
c) Compilation Error
d) Runtime Error
Answer: c
Explanation: Thread t has been made by using Runnable interface, hence it is necessary to use inherited abstract method run() method to specify instructions to be implemented on the thread, since no run() method is used it gives a compilation error.
Output:
$ javac multithreaded_programing.java
The type newthread must implement the inherited abstract method Runnable.run()

1908. QUESTION: 
a) Thread[New Thread,0,main].
b) Thread[New Thread,1,main].
c) Thread[New Thread,5,main].
d) Thread[New Thread,10,main].
Answer: d
Explanation: Thread t has been made with default priority value 5 but in run method the priority has been explicitly changed to MAX_PRIORITY of class thread, that is 10 by code ‘t.setPriority(Thread.MAX_PRIORITY);’ using the setPriority function of thread t.
Output:
$ javac multithreaded_programing.java
$ java multithreaded_programing
Thread[New Thread,10,main]

1909. QUESTION: 
a) true
b) false
c) truetrue
d) falsefalse
Answer: d
Explanation: Threads t1 & t2 are created by class newthread that is implementing runnable interface, hence both the threads are provided their own run() method specifying the actions to be taken. When constructor of newthread class is called first the run() method of t1 executes than the run method of t2 printing 2 times “false” as both the threads are not equal one is having different priority than other, hence falsefalse is printed.
Output:
$ javac multithreaded_programing.java
$ java multithreaded_programing
falsefalse
